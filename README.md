# Note Tkaing app using Express.js

## Description
In this code you will find a fully functional note taking app deployed using Heroku. I have created the back end of this app and connected it to the provided front end. Each note can be written, saved, and pulled back up to the main right column. There is a delete function that will be added at a later date. I had some system issues, but was able to push through them and work through the system admin errors.
